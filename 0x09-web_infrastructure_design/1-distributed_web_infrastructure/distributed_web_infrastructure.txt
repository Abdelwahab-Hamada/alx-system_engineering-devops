Load balancer : is to spread incoming requests to active server

Load balancer algorithm: round robin is an algorithm that distributes requests one by one

My load balancer enabling Active-Active setup: where both nodes are running the same services in the same time while Active-Passive setup if one is offline the other would be active

DATABASE Primary-Replica: enables one database server to be reblicated

Replica node is a copy of the primary Node
